## ADR Kit

This project uses [adr-kit](https://github.com/rvdbreemen/adr-kit). All architectural decisions live as ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Full guide: @.claude/adr-kit-guide.md

Authoring: `/adr-kit:adr` (or the `adr-generator` subagent).
Pre-commit verification: `bin/adr-judge` runs declarative `Enforcement` rules at commit time. ADRs with `llm_judge: true` are reviewed in-session via `/adr-kit:judge`.
